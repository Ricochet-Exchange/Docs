# üí± Ricochet Exchange(REX)

**Important Disclosures**

* All smart contracts are unaudited so usage is based on individual's discretion.
* Ricochet Exchange charges a 2% fee on all token swaps.
* You will lose tokens if your balance runs out while streaming (ensure you have enough funds before streaming!).

## Projects

Ricochet Exchange is aimed at producing pioneering tools that creates the opportunity for people to make real-time investments with their crypto assets  using Superfluid and Tellor's finance scheme. Essentially, these streaming operations are made so that they can actually be visualized and synchronously followed.  Learn more about each of our projects below.

### REX Market - [LIVE](https://app.ricochet.exchange)

This project centers around creating and maintaining a **branched-out trade system that supports automatic** **real-time investing** on Polygon. Ricochet Exchange contracts use Superfluid for streaming tokens and Tellor Oracle for getting prices, and SushiSwap/QuickSwap for regular market volatility. REX is used for both individual and organizational purposes to invest capital assets and income inflows in and out of ETH, WBTC and others. [Learn More](https://app.ricochet.exchange)

### REX Launchpad - [LIVE](https://app.ricochet.exchange)

The Launchpad intends on creating a **launchpad contract for projects to use to do fair and equal ICOs**. This launchpad does away with front-running by offering tokens at a fixed distribution rate. Streamers can compete to earn a portion of the eventual distributions. See an example below where the price discovery would put RIC's price at 0.50 USDC.

### Experimental Products

#### REX Tokens and REX LP streaming

REX Tokens are profitable tokens used in Ricochet Exchange to deliver real-time yield to streamers. REX Tokens represent a claim on yield-bearing ERC20 tokens staked in reward systems (e.g. SushiSwap Farms). Users run their USDC into the Ricochet market to receive REX Tokens. Tokens are denoted with a ‚Äúrex‚Äù prefix on the underlying token (e.g. rexSLP). The exchange takes the principal tokens and stakes them in a reward system. Streamers then receive the rewards produced in real-time directly to their wallet. [Learn More](https://github.com/Ricochet-Exchange/ricochet-lpx)

![rexLP is a method of dollar-cost averaging into staked LP tokens, for example above USDC is streamed into ETH-USDC LP tokens and those tokens are staked in Sushi Farms for MATIC and SUSHI rewards, while streaming to Ricochet, users receive back SLP, MATIC, and SUSHI tokens in real-time](.gitbook/assets/Ricochet\_-\_sushi.jpg)
