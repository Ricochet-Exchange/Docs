## Projects

Ricochet Exchange is focused on producing novel tools that allow people to invest their crypto assets in _real-time_ using Superfluid's finance framework. Learn more about each of our projects below.

### REX Market - [LIVE](https://app.ricochet.exchange)

This project involves creating and maintaining a **decentralized exchange that supports automatic** **real-time investing** on Polygon. Ricochet Exchange contracts use Superfluid for streaming tokens and Tellor Oracle for getting prices, and SushiSwap/QuickSwap for liquidity. Individuals and organizations use the exchange to invest their capital and inbound income streams into and out of ETH, WBTC, and others in real-time. [Learn More](https://app.ricochet.exchange)

### REX Launchpad - [LIVE](https://app.ricochet.exchange)

The Launchpad intends on creating a **launchpad contract for projects to use to do fair ICOs**. This launchpad does away with front-running by offering tokens at a fixed distribution rate. Streamers can compete to earn a portion of the distributions. See an example below where the price discovery would put RIC's price at 0.50 USDC.

### Experimental Products

#### REX Tokens and REX LP streaming

REX Tokens are yield-bearing tokens used in Ricochet Exchange to deliver real-time yield to streamers. REX Tokens represent a claim on yield-bearing ERC20 tokens staked in reward systems (e.g. SushiSwap Farms). Streamers stream USDC into an exchange to receive REX Tokens. Tokens are denoted with a “rex” prefix on the underlying token (e.g. rexSLP). The exchange takes the underlying tokens and stakes them in a reward system. Streamers then receive the rewards produced in real-time directly to their wallet. [Learn More](https://github.com/Ricochet-Exchange/ricochet-lpx)

![rexLP is a method of dollar-cost averaging into staked LP tokens, for example above USDC is streamed into ETH-USDC LP tokens and those tokens are staked in Sushi Farms for MATIC and SUSHI rewards, while streaming to Ricochet, users receive back SLP, MATIC, and SUSHI tokens in real-time](.gitbook/assets/Ricochet\_-\_sushi.jpg)
