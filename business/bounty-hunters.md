# 🏆 - Bounty Hunters

### Ricochet Bounty Hunters

Help build the future of real-time DeFi, shape your skills, and grow the Ricochet ecosystem. This program pays for performance. Anyone can bounty hunt here and earn RIC for their contributions.&#x20;

### What's the [**rexForce**](https://twitter.com/ricochetxchange/status/1484954247464509440?s=20\&t=oME9DsZuVeOmOQwvgFfGpQ)**?**

Currently, completing a bounty makes you a rexForce member. You'll get a designation in our Discord along with your contribution area (frontend, media creator, etc.). Stay tuned - soon being a part of the rexForce will mean a lot more. For a preview, check out Mike Ghen's explanation of D.A.W. [here](https://youtu.be/KH0roWMdZHg?t=39).

### How it works

* Bounties are open to anyone; most bounties are Github Issues
* Create a thread in Discord to claim and start working on a bounty
* All bounties are paid out in RIC tokens&#x20;
* All bounties are paid out after completion on Fridays. Payout based on $RIC price at time of completion.


The _Bounty Hunter Program_ is a **pay-for-performance-based** **compensation program** that pays contributors for their work.
