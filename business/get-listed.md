# - Get Listed

_This listing proposal process takes 7 days to complete._

## 1. Introduce Initiative (3 days)

In the #üí°-proposals channel, express the new asset you'd like to list and why you'd like to see it listed. Some topics you should mention/discuss:

* **Demand for token**: does this asset have enough of an audience that people would be interested in stream investing in/out of it?
* **Reputation of token's project**: it is best to list legit projects that have delivered clear value to the crypto ecosystem. Elaborate on the fundamentals behind in the asset and why it's something worth investing in.
* **Connection with team**: if you are connected with the team behind the asset, provide details such that the potential listing can be marketed.
* **rexMarket pairings**: if the asset is to be listed, exactly what stream markets should be made. For example, if listing $CRV is the subject, should both stablecoin bases $USDC‚Üî$CRV and $DAI‚Üî$CRV be listed? Just $USDC? Make sure this is clear.

Allow 3 days of discussion.

## 2. Heat Check Vote (1 day)

After the 3 days are up, draft your listing proposal and post it in in #üí°-proposals. Ask for the community's opinion with emoji reactions (üëç or üëé) like done [HERE](https://discord.com/channels/862796510604296263/866026126072348672/927263159629266984).&#x20;

The listing proposal should contain:

1. Name and ticker of token to be listed
2. Stream Markets to be created&#x20;
3. A brief bullet point enumeration of reasons for and against listing the token from the initiative introduction

See how sentiment is over the day. If you receive a majority of thumb downs, it may not be worth moving forward with the listing proposal.&#x20;

## 3. Snapshot Proposal (3 days)

You need 10,000 $RIC to make a proposal on the [Ricochet Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ricochet.eth). If you do not possess this amount, you can find another DAO member who will be willing to put up your proposal.

The proposal should be open for 3 days and the voting options should be yes/no.

Finally, inform the community with a message in #üí°-proposals that the vote has gone up so a Core Team member can make an announcement.

## 4. Listing

If the listing passes, the Core Team will create the rexMarket and list the token at the earliest convenience.
