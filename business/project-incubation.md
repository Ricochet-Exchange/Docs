# üê£ - Project Incubation

The Ricochet DAO seeks to lead the space of real-time DeFi. Projects working on stream-enabled DeFi tools are encouraged to join the REX brand and grow under the firepower of Ricochet's treasury and rexForce.

## What makes a project a good fit?

**Scope**: The project must be involved with real-time DeFi. Examples of projects that fit the mold would be [Supercard](https://twitter.com/getsupercard) (Superfluid revolving credit) and [dSIP](https://github.com/DAM-Protocol/SIP-Contracts) (stream investing in dHedge funds).

**Stage**: Early stage is best. Obviously, the Ricochet DAO will want projects that are working towards and have full conviction on a mainnet deployment. Projects that are already deployed and revenue-generating will be considered as well. This area is quite flexible.

## Why should you incubate under Ricochet?

### **Branding**&#x20;

By making your product a rex- product, you'll be given high exposure through Ricochet marketing efforts and general branding. It'll show up on our landing page, our docs, be discussed when rexForce captains go on AMAs and present to other orgs, etc. Ricochet's strong positioning in the Superfluid community will provide a powerful conduit for attention as well

### **rexForce**

Ricochet's **** development-driven community creates tremendous value contributor-wise. You'd have the rexForce ready to assist you with frontend, media assets, blog writing, contract testing, on top of the brand recognizability that Ricochet has in the Superfluid community to quickly drive users and product quality.

### Financing

Upon incubation, a $RIC funding line is opened from the Ricochet DAO to your project as a bedrock for project funding. Additional non-$RIC capital would be available on a proposal-basis. Through Ricochet's financial backing, a project can set bounties for to-do's, cover routine costs such as keepers, and more. Overall the Ricochet DAO's multi-million dollar treasury will give you the funding to get off the ground fast and amplify your efforts.&#x20;

## **Incubation Steps**&#x20;

1. **Raise awareness in community**: Inform community in #üí°-proposals of your project and interest in incubation, providing ample details.&#x20;
2.  **Propose incubation**: Make proposal for incubation following Snapshot voting process [here](https://docs.ricochet.exchange/business/usdric#snapshot-proposal-process).  Your proposal should follow these guidelines:

    1. Project Name and Team Members
    2. Project Details and why it fits under real-time DeFi
    3. Incubation parameters:
       1. Revenue allocation percentage: what percent of your project's revenue should be routed to the main Ricochet DAO treasury? This is typically around 20%
       2. Monthly $RIC funding: how much $RIC should be provisioned to your project for bounty funding? Consider the operational needs of your project.
    4. Any other details or deviations from the expected incubation process&#x20;

    If proposal is accepted, proceed with remaining steps üëá\

3. **Create multisig**: The Ricochet DAO will commission a multisig for your project to manage funding and revenue.
4. **Repo**: Communicate in #üõ†-developement to have your project's repositories transferred under Ricochet Exchange [Github org](https://github.com/Ricochet-Exchange/).
5. **Initializing bounties:**
   1. Issues on repos may be labelled as bounties as needed (for example, see how bounties are labelled on issues in our [frontend repo](https://github.com/Ricochet-Exchange/ricochet-frontend/issues))
   2. Create BD/Media bounty sheet ([example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1f7RwLY4VQuDj-xyPlSnRzqZky6awq-25Nkez5goXMsM/edit)).
6. **Documentation:** Project will be provided a dedicated documentation page in these docs. High-level project details and link to existing project docs (if available) are provided. All bounty materials (from Step 6) are linked in the [Bounty Hunters](https://docs.ricochet.exchange/business/bounty-hunters) page.
7. **Marketing:** The BizDev rexForce members will work on creating a marketing campaign for the release.
