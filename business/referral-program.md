## Why should become an Affiliate?

As an affiliate **you receive 50% of the fees charged by Ricochet** to accounts you refer. If you refer an account that DCAs $1000 with the protocol, Ricochet charges a 2% fee for the transaction, you would earn $10 (50% of the $20 fee). These rewards can provide a significant source of income if you are able to successfully refer a large amount of volume to the protocol.
