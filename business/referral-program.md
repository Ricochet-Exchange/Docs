&#x20; **** After you click register, you'll receive a signature request from your Metamask wallet for the link registration fee. Sign the request to proceed with your registration.

* **Step 3**

After successfully registering your referral link, you'll enter an approval period. The approval period is essentially completed in the discord; you'll get a pending approval message where you are redirected to the REX discord and you'll be approved as an affiliate.&#x20;

### Why should become an Affiliate member?

As an affiliate member, you receive **50%**  of Ricochet fee on token swaps made by your referee( i.e you earn half of REX fees on all streams made by the person you refer!).&#x20;

For example, if you refer someone and they make a stream of $1000 a month, REX charges 2% of the total funds, that's $20. If you're the referrer, you get $10 while Ricochet gets $10!&#x20;

Also, an affiliate member gets 1% of the total supply volume generated from referrals.&#x20;
