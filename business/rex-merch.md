## How is the rexSHIRT/HAT prices calculated?

REX Shirt and Hat are offered using the Ricochet Launchpad contract. There is a fixed emission rate of \~1/week. The tokens each have 52 total supplies since these are limited edition Ricochet Exchange merchandise.&#x20;

Here is an example for how the Ricochet launchpad discovers the price based on all the accounts that are willing to DCA into these tokens. This example is with people using USDC to get RIC tokens, so you'll need to imagine how this works when the input token is RIC and the output token is rexSHIRT.
