# ðŸ—³ - Ricochet DAO

## Overview

**Ricochet Token** (RIC) is the **Ricochet DAO** governance token. It has a **fixed supply of 10 million** tokens. All 10 million tokens were minted and transferred to the **Ricochet DAO Treasury**, a Gnosis multi-signature safe. RIC is used voting on how to use the funds accumulated in the DAO's Treasury. Below you'll find the official addresses of Ricochet DAO

Discussion and debate within the DAO occurs in the [Ricochet Discord](https://discord.gg/yHwzwrkm).

## Token Distribution

Ricochet's Whitepaper details how RIC will be distributed. The details are summarized below:

* 1,000,000 RIC to streamers as part of our V1 Liquidity Mining program
* 1,000,000 RIC to the Core Team that works on making V1 a success
* 8,000,000 RIC to the Ricochet DAO Treasury to be allocated by RIC holders

## Governance

{% hint style="info" %}
The primary role of governance is to **determine how to allocate the remaining 8,000,000 RIC** **and the fees collected** in the Ricochet DAO Treasury.
{% endhint %}

Token holders with more than 10,000 RIC be able to put forth proposals using Snapshot. The primary role of governance is to determine how to allocate the remaining 8,000,000 RIC and the fees collected in the Ricochet DAO Treasury. Proposals may include but are not limited to:&#x20;

* Listing new tokens on Ricochet
* Allocating RIC distributions for newly listed tokens
* Funding to complete projects and to reward contributes

### Participating in Governance

{% hint style="warning" %}
There are three ways to participate in governance:

1. Discussion for proposal should be done publicly in #proposals
2. Vote on proposals in Snapshot
3. Make proposals (**10,000 RIC is required** to be eligible to propose)
{% endhint %}

### Snapshot Proposal Process

1.  Make a thread in #ðŸ’¡-proposals in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/egu4FZbPBM).

    \- Start thread off with a summary of your proposal\
    \-  Include the desired structure of the Snapshot poll. This includes the vote duration, choices, voting system (single-choice, ranked choice, etc; Snapshot shows you the options)
2. Allow at least 72 hours of debate to take place. Consider new ideas and tweak proposal as needed.
3. Once sufficient debate has taken place and opinions have manifested, head over to Snapshot and cast the proposal out for voting.
4. Inform the community in #ðŸ’¡-proposals that voting is live.

## rexBank

rexBank is a contract that lets RIC token holders borrow funds from the Ricochet DAO at fixed interest rates. rexBank accepts RIC as collateral and supports borrowing USDC at a 12% interest rate and 1% origination fee. rexBank creates a close loop system where RIC holders can access liquidity that has accumulated in the Ricochet Treasury from fees collected on Ricochet Exchange.

![REX Bank is used by contributors who've earned RIC to access USDC to pay bills and buy food.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-11-19 at 4.33.04 PM (1).png>)

## V1 Liquidity Mining

10% of the $RIC supply is being distributed to users of our version 1 stream exchange contracts. During specified periods, users streaming into designated Stream Markets can earn RIC tokens proportional to the size of their streams.&#x20;

## $RIC is a SuperToken

RIC is a native Super Token. This means it only exists as an ERC777. RIC doesn't have an underlying ERC20 token that needs to be upgraded or downgraded.&#x20;

RIC as a SuperToken can do everything that an ERC20 token can do (be swapped on AMMs like SushiSwap, get transferred around, pushed around contracts, etc.) _plus_ get streamed/distributed via the Superfluid protocol. It's a super token for a reason... it's got superpowers!&#x20;
