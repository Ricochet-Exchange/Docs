## Tokens

Superfluid curates tokens on Mumbai for testing. Ricochet needs to make a Uniswap Liquidity Pool with these tokens so that the REX Market contracts have a pool to use. This table explains what tokens are available:

| Token                   | Token                                      | Supertoken                                 |
