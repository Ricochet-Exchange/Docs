### Fee Reductions

The Gelato fee can be reduced from the current 1% down to a lower limit of 0.01% (_1 basis point_). The fee can be lowered by the DAO after markets execute with a frequency less than 4 hours. Swaps less than every 4 hours is not going to make much of a difference relative to other DCA protocols. Some markets may have Gelato fees lower than 1%, this is the case for the USDC>>ETH.

## Referral Program Fees

{% content-ref url="../contributor-resources/affiliates.md" %}
[affiliates.md](../contributor-resources/affiliates.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The Ricochet Exchange protocol has a built in Referral System (REX Referral contract). Accounts can register as an affiliate through this contract. As an affiliate they can refer accounts using a link to the frontend application. Fees are then split 50/50 with the affiliate.&#x20;

The protocol takes no more and no less fees on accounts referred by the affiliate. All accounts interacting with Ricochet get the same fee, set at the smart contract level.&#x20;

| Protocol Fee distribution for referrals | Fee Share |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- |
| REX Registered Affiliate Account        | 50%       |
| Protocol Fee Collector Account          | 50%       |
