## Overview

Ricochet Exchange runs a Github organization administrated by @mikeghen. The organization contains repositories for each component of REX project. Those components are:

* **Ricochet Protocol** - These smart contracts power the backend of REX on Polygon
* **Ricochet Frontend** - The react application that REX customers use
* **Ricochet  Keeper** - REX's keeper codebase build on top of Apache Airflow

## Ricochet Protocol

This project includes the Solidity smart contracts that power Ricochet's services. The project is built using the Hardhat framework. Inside you can find contracts for the REXMarkets, REXBank, and REXReferral systems.&#x20;

## Ricochet Frontend

This project includes the React application that interfaces with the contracts on chain. The project is based on React and can be run locally in case the official Ricochet Exchange website goes down.

## Ricochet Keeper

Ricochet doesn't rely on third-party keeper networks. Instead, there are keepers in the rexForce community that run this custom keeper built on top of Apache Airflow&#x20;
