## Tokens

Superfluid curates tokens on Mumbai for testing. Ricochet needs to make a Uniswap Liquidity Pool with these tokens so that the REX Marekt contracts have a pool to use. This table explains what tokens are available:

| Token        | Token                                      | Supertoken                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| fUSDC/fUSDCx | 0xbe49ac1EadAc65dccf204D4Df81d650B50122aB2 | 0x42bb40bF79730451B11f6De1CbA222F17b87Afd7 |
