## **System Requirements**

* Virtual machine with&#x20;
  * \>4 GB of memory
  * a network connection (e.g. Digital Ocean Droplet)
* Four (4) funded Polygon wallets
  * You'll need to have the public address and private key for these wallets
  * Each wallet should be different to avoid collisions with nonces across workflows

## Keeper Workflows

This is a list that details the workflows that are run by the REX Keeper:

* **`ricochet_distribute`** - Periodically distributes for each REX Market
* **`ricochet_harvest`** - Periodically harvests yield from REX markets that support yield aggregation
* **`ricochet_tellor_reporter`** - Reports the price to the Tellor oracle
* **`ricochet_stream_closure`** - Checks on streamers balances, close before they run out
