# Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

## What's DCA?

#### Dollar-cost averaging is the process of automatically investing fixed amounts at fixed intervals. _For example_: Using a Ricochet rexMarket to buy $1 of Bitcoin every 20 minutes.

By employing this strategy, you're buying less of an asset as its price rises and more as it falls. Think of it like this: $100 will buy more Bitcoin when the price falls and less as it rises. Check out this visualization ðŸ‘‡

## Why should you DCA?

### 1. Save on _risk_

Notice the "number of shares owned" blue shading on the DCA Viz. As you continue to buy BTC, the dollars you've invested rises linearly. The advantage of this is you are taking on price risk gradually and incrementally instead of all at once. You're spreading your buys out across periodic prices instead of one or a few.

### 2. Save on _stress_

Buying crypto in lumps is nerve wracking. Even if you believe the token will rise in value, you could have entered at a poor price and end up regretting your decision. Timing the markets can leave investors second-guessing and FOMO'ing into losing bets!

How does DCA help? By incrementally investing your money over a period, you are able to find an average entry price (see the "average price" line on the DCA Viz). This takes out the guesswork, assuring that you aren't entering at a relatively terrible price and that you'll get a good night's sleep.

### 3. Save on _time_

Timing the markets is a time consuming process. And in the busy and fast-paced world of crypto, your time and attention is valuable! If you can reduce your investing strategy to just injudicious auto-buying in fixed amounts, you'll spend less time investing and more time doing other cool stuff.
