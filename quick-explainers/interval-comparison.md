# Empowering Streamed Salaries

## Effortlessly Automate Your Investing

Ricochet supercharges Superfluid stream salaries by giving users the ability to invest their tokens in adjunct streams. It's totally hands-off! \
\
**Allocating a portion of your streamed income into a Ricochet rexMarket is akin to auto-converting a part of your salary into a crypto of your choice.** For example, if you want to convert some of your DAI salary into MKR and ETH as it arrives to your â€¨wallet, just set set up streams into our MKR and ETH rexMarkets at whatever rate you'd like. Itâ€™s that simple! Check out the below ðŸ‘‡

Let's break this visualization down with an example:

1. Employer streams you your salary in DAI, let's say the **rate is 5k DAI/mo**.
2. You want to invest **5% of that income into ETH and 10% into MKR**.
3. You start a 250 DAI/mo. stream into the DAIâ†’ETH rexMarket
4. You start a 500 DAI/mo. stream into the DAIâ†’MKR rexMarket
5. Kick back and relax as Ricochet begins auto-buying ETH and MKR for you!

## The Streaming Portfolio

**One way to think of it is that using the wide selection of stream markets available on Ricochet dApp, you are able to convert your salary into a custom "streaming portfolio"**. The process is akin to subscribing to a custom investment plan of your choice. Only this investment plan puts your money to work the second you receive it.

Beyond just investing into tokens, Ricochet also offers rexLP which allows you to convert your streams into yield-bearing Sushi LP tokens. The yield and earned trading fees accrue straight to your wallet with no need to claim. Through rexLP, users can automate their yield strategies to passively create passive income!

## Networked Cashflows

This is the core idea that makes Ricochet so revolutionary in automating investment strategies.

When you take a part of your salary stream and stream that out to a rexMarket, you're already engaging in a networked cashflow. Stream in and then stream out.&#x20;

Let's take that a step further - consider that rapid 20 minute distributions of the target asset you're getting back from the rexMarket. What if you could take that target asset and stream it into something else, like a rexLP, and earn additional yield on it? Check out the below ðŸ‘‡

That looks kinda elaborate, but it's really not that complex! Let's break down what's happening:

1. Employer streams you your salary in USDC, let's say the **rate is 5k USDC/mo**.
2. You want to invest **10% of that income into ETH which you will in turn stake in the USDC/WETH Sushi LP for additional yield.**
3. You start a 500 USDC/mo. stream into the USDCâ†’ETH rexMarket&#x20;
4. You begin receiving distributions of ETH.
5. With the ETH you are receiving, you start a stream of $400 of ETH/mo. into the ETHâ†’USDC/ETH rexLP&#x20;
6. You start receiving distributions of USDC/ETH LP tokens plus your position's yield (straight to your wallet, no need to claim)

And just like that, you have an yield-bearing investment engine running for you! If you examine the above steps, you'll see that **it only took 2 transactions** (Steps 3 and 5). With networked cashflows, we can automate tried and true investment strategies to effortlessly make your money work for you like never before.
