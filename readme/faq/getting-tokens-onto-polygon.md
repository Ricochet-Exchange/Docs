# Getting funds onto Polygon?

### Bridging from Ethereum Mainnet

The [official Polygon MATIC Wallet has a built in bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge), where you can send various assets from Ethereum (ETH). Note that a fee will need to be paid in ETH to bridge your assets.

This bridge currently supports a variety of tokens and is easy to use. It is the **official and recommended** method to bridge funds safely onto Polygon blockchain.

### **Bridging from BSC to Polygon**&#x20;

There is an **unofficial BSC/xDAI to Polygon bridge**, by [xPollinate](https://www.xpollinate.io/). A small fee is charged for using this service, which will be detailed for you before accepting the transfer.

Supported tokens for bridging:

* DAI
* USDC
* USDT

During busy times, the Polygon MATIC exit liquidity on xPollinate may be insufficient for your desired amount. Keep refreshing xPollinate's homepage every so often, to check when there is enough liquidity for your transaction!

Other **unofficial Bridges to Polygon bridges include ApeSwap, EvoDefi and Anyswap** A small fee is charged for using this service, which will be detailed for you before accepting the transfer.

### Starting with fiat?

Currently, [AscendEX (formerly BitMax)](https://ascendex.com/), [Binance](https://binance.com), [Huobi Wallet](https://www.huobiwallet.com/), [Okex](https://www.okex.com/) and [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) support withdrawals straight to Polygon blockchain.

No bridge is required for this. You will need to register an account to use the exchanges. There may be fees associated with withdrawals. Exchanges only support deposits/withdrawals from specific tokens.&#x20;

Always DYOR on the exchange, their supported tokens and fees!
