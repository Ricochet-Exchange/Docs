The Ricochet Exchange protocol has a built in Referral System (REX Referral contract). Accounts can register as an affiliate through this contract. As an affiliate they can refer accounts using a link to the frontend application. Fees are then split 50/50 with the affiliate.&#x20;

The protocol takes no more and no less fees on accounts referred by the affiliate. All accounts interacting with Ricochet get the same fee, set at the smart contract level.&#x20;

| Protocol Fee distribution for referrals | Fee Share |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- |
| REX Registered Affiliate Account        | 50%       |
| Protocol Fee Collector Account          | 50%       |
