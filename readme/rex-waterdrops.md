## Overview

WaterDrops are a way to distribute tokens to recipients in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than traditional airdrops. In contrast to airdrops, which require recipients to make multiple claims in order to receive their tokens, WaterDrops allow recipients to claim once and then receive their tokens automatically and continuously over time. This process is made possible through the use of various technologies, such as Hardhat, Superfluid, Gelato, and Polygon.
