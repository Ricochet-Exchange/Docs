# ðŸ—³ - Ricochet DAO

## Overview

Ricochet Token (RIC) is the [Ricochet DAO](https://discord.gg/yHwzwrkm) governance token with a  fixed supply of 10 million tokens. All 10 million tokens were minted and transferred to the Ricochet DAO Treasury, a Gnosis multi-signature safe. RIC uses voting to decide on how to use the funds accumulated in the DAO's Treasury and to make other decisions. Below are the official addresses of Ricochet DAO.

### Bug Bounty

Ricochet DAO has a history of rewarding bug hunters so get in touch right away if you find any bugs in the protocol or application.&#x20;

Version 2 protocol and app will require bug fixes so there is a bounty program specifically for tackling the bugs. Submit bugs as Github issues and share them in #development in Discord.&#x20;

### Participating in Governance

Ricochet DAO uses token gating on Discord and governance discussions happen behind the token gating. You need to meet one of these qualifications to access the token-gated channel where governance is discussed:

1. Stream 20 USDC/month to the Ricochet Launchpad
2. Hold 100K RIC tokens

Use #collabland-join channel on Discord to verify your wallet and access the communications channels you need to participate in Ricochet DAO governance.

### Snapshot Proposal Process

1. Make a thread in #proposals in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/egu4FZbPBM).
   1. Start thread off with a summary of your proposal
   2. Include the desired structure of the Snapshot poll. This includes the vote duration, choices, voting system (single-choice, ranked choice, etc; Snapshot shows you the options)
2. Allow at least 72 hours of debate to take place. Consider new ideas and tweak proposal as needed.
3. Once sufficient debate has taken place and opinions have manifested, head over to Snapshot and cast the proposal out for voting.
4. Inform the community in #proposals that voting is live.

## RIC Liquidity Mining

Ricochet went live on July 15th 2021 and started to incentivize liquidity on the protocol by issue ing a RIC token. 10% of the $RIC supply is being distributed to users of our version 1 stream exchange contracts. During specified periods, users streaming into designated Stream Markets can earn RIC tokens proportional to the size of their streams.&#x20;

RIC incentives are ongoing on it's markets. Check the application to see which markets are being incentivized at anytime. Here's a history of the first 10% of incentives for Ricochet:
