# üèÉ‚ôÇ - Quickstart

## Streaming USDC to ETH

{% hint style="success" %}
This tutorial assumes you have USDC on Polygon
{% endhint %}

### 1. Approve your USDC on the Wallet page

**What's going on?** \
****Basically, you're allowing the USDCx contract to receive your USDC.

### 2. Upgrade your USDC on the Wallet page

![](../.gitbook/assets/upgrade.png)

**What's going on?**\
****You're wrapping your USDC into USDCx which gives it the ability to be streamed using Superfluid

### 3. Enter how much USDCx you want to stream per month and hit start on the Invest page

**What's going on?**\
****USDCx will begin to stream out of your wallet by the second into the USDC>>ETH Stream Market smart contract which will distribute the appropriate amount of WETHx back to you each hour. Basically, hourly dollar-cost-averaging (DCA)

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can start a stream for more than your wallet balance. For the above example, the USDCx balance will exhaust after 1/2 a month because you're streaming at a rate of 700 USDCx/month and you only have 350 USDCx.
{% endhint %}

### **4. Downgrade your accumulated WETHx balance on the Wallet Page**

So, some time has passed and you've accumulated some WETHx. Now you want to downgrade to plain ol' WETH. Go to the downgrade widget on the Wallet page.

Put in the amount of WETHx you want to downgrade, hit downgrade, confirm the transaction, and wait for the WETH to appear in your wallet!

**What's going on?**\
****You unwrapped the WETHx you were distributed by Ricochet into regular WETH.
